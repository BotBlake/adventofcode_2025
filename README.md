# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/).

I’m not entirely sure why you’re looking at this repo, but feel free to explore.

This repository contains solutions in both python, and GoLang.
To run the project, execute `main`; if you want to run a specific day, use `main [day]`.

> [!TIP]
> The script automatically determines the current date and runs the corresponding day's solution. Outside of December, you'll need to specify the day manually.

**Python**
Dependencies are managed through both `uv` and `dependencies.txt`.
You can get started with either `uv sync` / `uv run main.py` or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` / `python main.py`.

**GoLang**
This is one of my first go projects.
You should be good by simply running `main.go`.
If not, then... I dont know either :D

Now; Lets help the Elves save Christmas
