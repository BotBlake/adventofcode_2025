# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/). I’m not entirely sure why you’re looking at this repo, but feel free to explore. To run the project, execute `main.py`; if you want to run a specific day, use `main.py [day]`.

[!TIP]
The script automatically determines the current date and runs the corresponding day's solution. Outside of December, you'll need to specify the day manually.

Dependencies are managed through both `uv` and `dependencies.txt`.
You can get started with either `uv sync` / `uv run main.py` or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` / `python main.py`.
